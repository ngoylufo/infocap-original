# InfoCap

It's just a simple website (webapp?) for input some data and storing it in a database.
Then retrieving and presenting that data on a table with some ajax involved.

## What is this

This is code I wrote around November 2018 for a job interview. I was quite a noob then
so forgive the lack of style and best practices here. I'm putting the code up here for
storage reasons mainly. Maybe I'll revisit it some day.

I wrote it myself, although the ideas here are not entirely my own.

## Installation

In case you want to try it out you'll need to have something like xampp installed as
this code uses a mysql database and assumes the site is accessible through localhost.

1. Create an `infocap` database and import `infocap.sql`.
1. Unless you've changed some of the code, move the infocap folder to wherever
localhost is on your computer.

That's it, enjoy I guess.
